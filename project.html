        Ambani was the third of five children born to a village schoolteacher
        and his wife, and he grew up in a family of modest means. At the age of
        17, he migrated to the British colony of Aden to join his brother. He
        started his career as a clerk at A. Besse & Co., which in the 1950s was
        the largest transcontinental trading firm east of Suez. There he learned
        trading, accounting, and other business skills. In 1958 Ambani returned
        to India and settled in Bombay (now Mumbai).
